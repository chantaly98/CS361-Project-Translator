# Project Title: Translator

## Website Description:

Welcome to the Translator website! This platform utilizes an API to facilitate word or sentence translations. Explore various features such as entering a word or phrase for translation, changing the language, getting a word count, or letting the translator choose a random word for you. You can also bookmark/save phrases for future reference. The Translator app can even pronounce words aloud using the speaker icon. For additional assistance, check out the help section. Happy Translating!

## How it was made:

The backend script is built using Node.js and Express. The code sets up a basic Express server, defines routes, and interacts with Python code from Node.js. The frontend, built with JavaScript, runs in the user's browser and interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to manipulate HTML elements, handle user interactions, and make asynchronous requests to external APIs.

As part of this school project, my partner and I wrote microservices for each other and incorporated them into our individual projects. This microservice is specifically integrated into the word count feature in the Translator box.
